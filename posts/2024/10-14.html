  <h1>Introducing BDK Swift Example Wallet</h1>
  <h2 style="color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0;">Design Decisions</h2>
  <small>October 14, 2024</small>
  
  <article>
    <p><a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org">Bitcoin Dev Kit 1.0</a> has arrived, bringing with it powerful features and improvements for bitcoin application developers. To showcase how these capabilities can be used in a iOS app, I developed <a href="https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/BDKSwiftExampleWallet">BDK Swift Example Wallet</a>, an example app that leverages the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-ffi">Swift bindings</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-ffi">bdk-ffi</a>.</p>

    <p>In this post, I'll walk through the design principles and implementation choices that guided the creation of this example app. My goal is to highlight specific decisions I made, <em>some of which align with best practices</em> commonly seen in other wallets and <em>some that intentionally deviate from them</em>.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The people that might enjoy this wallet are people looking to:</p>
    
    <h4>Test</h4>
    <p>Bitcoiners interested in an iOS test wallet that supports networks like Signet & Testnet, allowing them to play around with bitcoin without using real funds.</p>
    
    <h4>Explore</h4>
    <p>Developers looking to explore BDK 1.0 and experiment with the new features of BDK 1.0.</p>
    
    <h4>Fork</h4>
    <p>Developers wanting to build on or fork this project using it as a solid starting point to create their own wallet or bitcoin-related app or adding a specific feature or idea to it.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <h3>Native</h3>
    <p>Most people will use bitcoin primarily on mobile devices, so focusing on a smooth and intuitive mobile experience was essential. This is why I aimed to build an app that leverages the power of BDK and feels like a true iOS native app, intentionally crafted to feel as natural on the platform as possible, where the use of built-in elements like bitcoin SF Symbols, light & dark mode, Dynamic Type, gestures and animations, and other iOS native components enhance usability for users.</p>

    <p>When an app feels native, it makes even complicated tasks seem straightforward; conversely, if the app doesn't feel like it belongs on the platform, even simple tasks can feel more difficult than they should.</p>

    <h3>Onboard</h3>

      style="width: 301px; height: 655px; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 40px;"

    <p>A key focus area for the app was creating an onboarding experience that gets users into the app with minimal friction. The features I focused on were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a new wallet or import a wallet</li>
      <li>Choose a test network and explora</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Originally, I experimented with a more complicated onboarding flow that spanned 2+ screens and offered more customization options, yet that also offered more surface area for users to get stuck. But I was really focused on preventing the user from feeling overwhelmed or stuck when they first open the app, I wanted to get them onboarded feeling confident and excited with momentum to continue using the app.</p>

    <p>So I streamlined onboarding to one screen, set the default network to <a href="https://mutinynet.com">Mutinynet</a>, and made creating or importing a wallet one-tap actions.</p>

    <h3>Wallet</h3>
    
    <img 
      src="/img/2024/10-14/wallet.png" 
      alt="BDK Swift Example Wallet Balance" 
      style="width: 301px; height: 655px; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 40px;"
    >

    <p>I used a custom approach to balance formatting that I haven't seen implemented the same exact way elsewhere; it resembles the satcomma standard, but I opted for a variation that makes the most sense to me reading when I'm reading a balance amount:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>~0.07 bitcoin</li>
      <li>~7 million sats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For ease of use on mobile devices, the "Send" and "Receive" actions are positioned at the bottom of the screen, within easy reach of a user's thumb. To keep the design minimal, these actions are represented by icons that make sense for a mobile wallet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show QR (Receive)</li>
      <li>Scan QR (Send)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>… rather than text, making the interface cleaner and more efficient.</p>

    <h3>Sync</h3>
    <p>One of the features I was most excited about in BDK 1.0 was the ability to <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/2024/01/bdk-1.0.0-beta.1/#inspect-script-pubkeys">inspect Script PubKeys</a> (SPKs) during wallet sync, because I could immediately imagine in my head how great that could look in a wallet.</p>

      style="width: 301px; height: 655px; margin: 1em 0; display: block; object-fit: cover;"
      playsinline
    ></video>

    <p>The <strong>halting problem</strong> is the problem of determining… whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever.</p>

    <h3>Receive</h3>

      src="/img/2024/10-14/receive.png" 
      alt="BDK Swift Example Wallet Receive Screen" 
      style="width: 301px; height: 655px; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 40px;"
    >
    
    <p>I implemented visual formatting for bitcoin addresses based on the <a href="https://bitcoin.design/guide/">Bitcoin Design Guide</a>. This formatting helps users quickly recognize the structure of a bitcoin address, reducing the chance of errors when copying or sharing it. By clearly presenting the address in a more digestible format, users are encouraged to review the entire address, which can help prevent mistakes during transactions.</p>

    <h3>Send</h3>

    <video 
      src="/img/2024/10-14/send.mp4" 
      controls 
      style="width: 301px; height: 655px; margin: 1em 0; display: block; object-fit: cover;"
      playsinline
    ></video>
    
    <p>I've seen similar send flow in a lot of my favorite wallet apps, and I think it's a great approach that I wanted to stay consistent with since it creates a clean and intuitive experience.</p>

    <h3>Seed</h3>

    <img 
      src="/img/2024/10-14/seed.png" 
      alt="BDK Swift Example Wallet Seed Screen" 
      style="width: 301px; height: 655px; margin: 1em 0; border-radius: 40px;"
    >
    
    <p>I referred to the guidelines from the Bitcoin Design Community's <a href="https://bitcoin.design/guide/daily-spending-wallet/">Daily Spending Wallet</a> for anytime the seed was shown in the app that it was presented which creates a nice visual representation of the seed words for a user.</p>

    <h3>Download</h3>
    
    <p>By focusing on simplicity, transparency, and native design principles, I've tried to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/BDKSwiftExampleWallet">develop</a> and <a href="https://bitcoin.design/guide/">design</a> a wallet that feels right at home on iOS while staying true to the needs of bitcoin users and developers.</p>
